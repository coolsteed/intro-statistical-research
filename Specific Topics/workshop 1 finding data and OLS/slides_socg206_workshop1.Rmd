Research design is more important than your model!

## Data, where you can find it?

- Use replication data or data used by previous research

- Find your data through variables.

## Let's do some gardening!

let's lm(y~x)! 

## There is not much difference between R and stata

* They are just software, choose whatever fits your needs. 

* It's statistics after all.
