# Global Stat- Are the relationships between your X predictors and Y roughly linear?. Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates a non-linear relationship between one or more of your Xâ€™s and Y
# Skewness - Is your distribution skewed positively or negatively, necessitating a transformation to meet the assumption of normality? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that you should likely transform your data.
# Kurtosis- Is your distribution kurtotic (highly peaked or very shallowly peaked), necessitating a transformation to meet the assumption of normality? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that you should likely transform your data.
# Link Function- Is your dependent variable truly continuous, or categorical? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that you should use an alternative form of the generalized linear model (e.g. logistic or binomial regression).
# Heteroscedasticity- Is the variance of your model residuals constant across the range of X (assumption of homoscedastiity)? Rejection of the null (p < .05) indicates that your residuals are heteroscedastic, and thus non-constant across the range of X. Your model is better/worse at predicting for certain ranges of your X scales.

## What about collinearity?
library(car)
vif(model_full) # usually, sqrt(vif)>2 implies that there is a multicollinearity problem
sqrt(vif(model_full)) > 2

# You can search for other packages for other test.
