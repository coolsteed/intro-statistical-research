# Documentation
# This part will explain the purpose of the code, and who creates it.
# This is a pseudo code to explain what a script for a quantitative project 
# should be formatted. Once you dissect it into different parts, you can easily
# solve problems you encounter along the road by googling them. 
# This is also called procedural coding.

#### Setting the working environment ####
## setting your working directory
## loading your packages (install them freshly if necessary)
## read in your data
## notes: for most research, the core object you have is a dataframe. 

#### Recoding Your Data ####
## Recoding your dependent variable
# You decide to measure/operationalize your concept in certain way, and usually
# you can recode it first. 

## Recoding your key independent variable(s)
# There is usally not that many independent variables. Unless you have multiple 
# hypotheses to test.

## Recoding your control variables 
# There are usually other control variables you should added into your model. 
# For this part, it is usually very helpful to resort to previous research. 
# You SHOULD NOT add too many! It will usually cause co-linearity problems. 
# It is also very problematic in terms of causal relations. 
# The best practice is to add variables that has theoretical importance in 
# competitive explanations. 

## imputing the missing data
# If missing data is a issue, you should deal with it first. Choose your method
# of imputation.

#### Exploration Part ####
# Usually this part you will have some descriptive statistics that describe 
# your dv and ivs. Also, you can use scatter plots, two way tables to assess 
# your hypothesis. 
# Usually, a true association will be strong enough even if other control 
# variables are added. 
# You should also provide a descriptive table for all control variables. 

#### Modeling part ####
## Modeling your hypotheses
# This is the part you model your hypotheses, using the models we learn from 
# the class and choose the most suitable one. 

## Model diagnosis
# You should also include post-modeling diagnosis in this part to make sure 
# that your results are robust.
# There are some we covered in the class. 
# You can also present a sub sample, or using other data/measurement to ensure 
# that the results are replicable in other datasets or robust across different
# measurements. 

#### Presenting Your Results ####
# Choose a good format to present your results, including visualizations or 
# using tables.
