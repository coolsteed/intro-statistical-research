## Generating the population
# randomly generate a population from normal distribution with 1000 cases
# 1000 as the mean and 30 as the sd
set.seed(92037) # set the random seed to make it replicable
# using rnorm to generate a population
pop <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1000, sd = 400) # see pnorm for calculating the intervals
hist(pop) # you see some of the population are in debt.
pop_mean <- mean(pop) # since it is randomly generated, it is not 1000 exactly.
# sample one time from it
sample_one <- sample(pop, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_mean <- mean(sample_one)
sample_mean
## now, sample it for 10000 times
# to make sure each sample is different, we need a different random seed
seeds <- c(1:10000)
# create a dataframe
sampling_dis <- data.frame(mean = rep(0, 10000))
# simulating the sampling distribution
for (i in 1:10000) {
