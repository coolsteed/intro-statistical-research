# Further Materials to Learn Statistics and Coding

## Introduction

The purpose of this course, to put it simple, is to train you as a consumer of statistics so that you can appreciate quantitative research and use them in your own research. The sequence provided by the department lays a good foundation that you can continue to explore statistic methods that fit your research and professional needs. You can also check statistic classes about specific topics offered by Political Science, GPS, Cognitive Science, Psychology and Economics etc. This doc lists some general readings that you can learn by yourselves. 

## Math Background

Usually you need to have some background knowledge about linear algebra and calculus to understand statistic better. Both options are good and the second one also include some more basic knowledge.

Fox, John. A mathematical primer for social statistics. India: SAGE Publications, 2009.

Siegel, David A.., Moore, Will H.. A Mathematics Course for Political and Social Research. United States: Princeton University Press, 2013.

## Coding with R and Python

There are plenty of resources online about this topic, I list a few of them.

Kabacoff, Rob. R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R. United States: Manning Publications, 2015.

After learning base R, you can try to learn tidyverse package

Grolemund, Garrett., Wickham, Hadley. R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data. United States: O'Reilly Media, 2016.

Healy has a great book for sociologists on visualization. 

Healy, Kieran. Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction. United Kingdom: Princeton University Press, 2018.

If you want to get a taste of Python

Shaw, Zed. Learn Python the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code. United Kingdom: Addison-Wesley, 2014.

## Statistics in Social Science

I do not think there is a division between quantitative and qualitative sociology, but methods and tools have their limitation and you need to pay attention to. 

Martin, John Levi. Thinking Through Statistics. United Kingdom: University of Chicago Press, 2018.

For the working routine, Kieran Healy has one booklet that is very helpful, though he is old school and you do not need to take every points he made.

Healy, Kieran, The Plain Person's Guide to Plain Text Social Science. 2018. https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/plain-person-text.pdf

## Other Resources on Campus

UCSD library Datalab: they are very helpful in terms of helping you find data and also with coding problems.
